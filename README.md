This project was created specifically for The Avatar Factory and serves as the technical task for the Three.js Front-end Developer position. The main goal of this project is to display a model (Test Camila), apply animations, and showcase different emotions.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for production.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - A cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework.
- [Lamina](https://lamina.js.org/) - A declarative way of working with WebGL.
- [Leva](https://leva.engine.gl/) - The first component input library for Vue and React.
- [Next Cloudinary](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/next-cloudinary) - Seamless Cloudinary image integration for Next.js.

## Description

One of the challenges encountered in this project was the highly detailed model (200 MB) which affected optimization and loading speed. To address this, the model was compressed, resulting in a reduced size of 150 MB.

Additionally, a custom character was created and animated. With the help of AI, the text was converted to speech, and lip synchronization was added to the animation.

Significant effort was dedicated to optimization and reducing user waiting time. To achieve this, the avatar was exported without textures, and a special preloader was created to provide users with a preview of what they will see on the screen.
